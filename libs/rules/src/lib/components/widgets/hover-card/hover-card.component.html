      <!-- this is workaround to create a dynamic _ngcontent  reference so we can refer to later on with dynamic
              projection. We cannot really use componentFactory.create[injector, projectedContent] as what we
              want to add is another angular component that needs to be still rendered.

              Starting PrimeNG 6.1+ they put in ngIf which complicates programmatic creation of this
              component and injecting another dynamic content into ngContent is hard, so we need to little
              hacky hackity hack.

              We have this extra span with a class that we use to insert out dynamic content using nativeElement
              and its DOM manipulation and once the overlay is shown and ng-content appears we move "u-ngcontent"
              to new location.

       -->
        <span class="u-ngcontent" [style.display]="'none'">
        </span>
    </div>
